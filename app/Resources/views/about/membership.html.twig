        <p class="Benefit">EGS has an extensive game library for every platform from old to new generation console games. EGS members are allowed to borrow a game for one week.
            <br>To borrow a game, the student EGS member must read over the Game Rental Contract and sign it with one of our EGS Executive Board members.
            <br>Simple Rules; The game must be returned within one week of its signed contract date, in its original condition, and with the 'EGS' label on it. An EGS member may only borrow one game at a time. The EGS member must follow all Federal, State, Local City, and RIT laws and policies. If any violation of this contract occurs or the game disc is returned damaged, the student EGS member's privilege of game renting will be revoked and they will be asked to replace the disc as it is RIT property. To read and discuss the Game Rental contract, and take out a game, please speak with an EGS Executive Board member, and they will gladly assist you.
            <br>(We will be uploading a game library inventory list soon!)
