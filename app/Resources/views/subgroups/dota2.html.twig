            The Dota 2 community at RIT is a place for all fans of the game to discuss, watch, and play together. We aim to establish a community of people who enjoy Dota 2 by promoting interactions with players both online and offline throughout EGS, RIT, and the Greater Rochester Area. We host many events including student body meetings, viewing parties, tournaments, in-house games, as well as social gatherings. We hope to raise awareness of Dota 2 across the campus and help introduce new players to the game.
